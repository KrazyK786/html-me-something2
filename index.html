                    <p>“Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.”</p>

                    <p>“The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.”</p>

                    <p>Per the theories above, the use of technology will only increase exponentially as technology advances.  By extension, this means programming will be more and more involved throughout the world.  According to code.org, Missouri alone has 8,728 open computing jobs with only 1,378 Computer Science graduates.</p>
                    <p>While having a computer science degree is certainly a bonus, it is not required to be able to learn to build applications and with the current and future demand noted above, people from all backgrounds will be needed in order to mobilize the needed workforce to continue the pace of growth</p>

                    <p>Of high importance in all of this is the fact that all of this means there is <strong>opportunity</strong> available.  Opportunity that is within reach for many Americans.  There is an entire workforce out there that with a little training, is ready and willing to be tapped and most important of all, that workforce is <strong>DIVERSE</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Our country has been called a melting pot and now, more than ever, it is important for that to be reflected in the things we produce.  One way to guarantee that from an application point of view, is to have a diverse set of software developers in the workforce.  On the surface, to some this may seem like a political statement or ‘culture wars’ topic, but a closer examination can reveal some of the benefits.  In 2009, HP had to deal with issues surrounding a motion tracking web camera that displayed difficulty tracking darker skin tones.  While it is not likely that the code running the camera was programmed specifically for lighter skin tones, it is likely that the team writing the code did not include very many people of color.</p>

                    <p>Having programmers from all walks of life including race, gender, religion, age, and sexual orientation means more people to be conscious of all the various implicit biases we carry and provides a little defense against those biases making it into the software applications being developed.</p>

                    <p>Programs like LaunchCode, are building the framework to make this a reality so that we as a society realize the skills it takes to learn to program are not entirely different from the skills it takes to do just about any other job out there and there is little reason why those skills could not be transferable.  Plus, who better to write the next program for construction worker safety or restaurant efficiency than someone who has experience in the field.</p>

                    <p>We do not have to sit back and let software development be an exclusive club that makes decisions for us; we can learn to do it as well and assist in building our collective future.</p>
